## 0.0 The Mockup design

![](../Assets/Success-on-empty-screen.png)

## 1. General Information
- **Module**: DMSuccessView
- **Description**: A custom SwiftUI view that displays a success state with an image and optional text. It uses a settings provider (`DMSuccessViewSettings`) to configure its appearance.
- **Type of Tests**: Functional Tests (BDD), Unit Testing, Snapshot Testing.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

## 2. Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: ✅ Verify Default Initialization
- **Description**: Check if the `DMSuccessView` is initialized correctly with default settings.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Create a new instance of `DMSuccessView` with default settings (`DMSuccessDefaultViewSettings`).
  - [✅] Verify that the success image is displayed as a checkmark circle icon.
  - [✅] Verify that the success text is `"Success!"`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The view is initialized correctly with default settings.
  - The success image and text match the expected behavior.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 2: ✅ Verify Success Image Behavior
- **Description**: Check if the success image is styled correctly based on the `successImageProperties`.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Create a new instance of `DMSuccessView` with custom `successImageProperties`.
  - [✅] Set the `image` to `Image(systemName: "star.fill")`, `foregroundColor` to `.yellow`, and `frame` to `CustomViewSize(width: 60, height: 60)`.
  - [✅] Verify that the success image is displayed with the correct image.
  - [✅] Verify that the foreground color is yellow.
  - [✅] Verify that the frame size is 60x60.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The success image is styled correctly with the specified properties.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 3: ✅ Verify Success Text Behavior
- **Description**: Check if the success text is styled correctly based on the `successTextProperties`.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Create a new instance of `DMSuccessView` with custom `successTextProperties`.
  - [✅] Set the `text` to `"Operation Completed!"` and `foregroundColor` to `.green`.
  - [✅] Verify that the success text is `"Operation Completed!"`.
  - [✅] Verify that the foreground color is green.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The success text is styled correctly with the specified properties.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 4: ✅ Verify Layout and Alignment
- **Description**: Check if the layout ensures proper alignment and spacing between the image and text.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Create a new instance of `DMSuccessView` with default settings.
  - [✅] Verify that the image and text are vertically aligned by `.center`.
  - [✅] Verify that the spacing between the image and text is consistent.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The layout ensures proper alignment and spacing between the image and text.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 5: ? Verify Snapshot Testing
- **Description**: Use snapshot testing to verify the visual appearance of the `DMSuccessView`.
- **Steps**:
  - [?] Create a new instance of `DMSuccessView` with default settings.
  - [?] Render the view using a snapshot testing library (e.g., `SnapshotTesting` or `XCTest`).
  - [?] Compare the rendered view with a reference snapshot.
  - [?] Verify that the snapshot matches the reference image.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The rendered view matches the reference snapshot.
  - If the test fails, update the snapshot only after verifying intentional UI changes.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

## 3. Test Data
| Method               | Input Data                          | Expected Output                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Default Initialization | None                                | `DMSuccessView` with default settings |
| Success Image        | Image: `"star.fill"`, Foreground Color: `.yellow`, Frame Size: `60x60` | Success image styled with specified properties |
| Success Text         | Text: `"Operation Completed!"`, Foreground Color: `.black` | Success text styled with specified properties |
| Layout and Alignment | None                                | Proper alignment and spacing between image and text |
| Snapshot Testing     | Default Settings                   | Snapshot matches the reference image |

## 4. Notes
- Use snapshot testing to verify the visual appearance of `DMSuccessView`.
  - Libraries like `SnapshotTesting` or `XCTest` can be used for this purpose.
  - Ensure that snapshots are updated only after verifying intentional UI changes.
- Use unit inspection to programmatically validate the styling and behavior.
- Ensure that all tests are performed on multiple devices and screen sizes to verify responsiveness.
- Localization testing should cover at least two languages (e.g., English and Ukrainian) if your app supports localization.

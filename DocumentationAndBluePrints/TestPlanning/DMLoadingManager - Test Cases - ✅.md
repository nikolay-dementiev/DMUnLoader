# Test Cases: "DMLoadingManager"

## 1. ✅ General Information
- **Module**: DMLoadingManager
- **Description**: A `ViewModel` responsible for managing and handling loading states in a user interface. It supports states such as `.none`, `.loading`, `.success`, and `.failure`, and includes an inactivity timer for auto-hiding.
- **Type of Tests**: Functional Tests (BDD), Unit Testing, Snapshot Testing (optional).
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

## 2. Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: ✅ Verify Default Initialization
- **Description**: Check if the `DMLoadingManager` is initialized correctly with default settings.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Create a new instance of `DMLoadingManager`.
  - [✅] Verify that new instance conforms to `DMLoadingManagerProtocol`
  - [✅] Verify that the initial `loadableState` is `.none`.
  - [✅] Verify that the `settings` are set to `DMLoadingManagerDefaultSettings`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` is `.none`.
  - The `settings` match `DMLoadingManagerDefaultSettings`.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 2: ✅ Verify Loading State
- **Description**: Check if the `DMLoadingManager` correctly transitions to the `.loading` state.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Call the `showLoading(provider:)` method with a `DMLoadingViewProvider` object.
  - [✅] Verify that the `loadableState` is `.loading`.
  - [✅] Verify that the inactivity timer is stopped.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` is `.loading`.
  - The inactivity timer is stopped.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 3: ✅ Verify Success State
- **Description**: Check if the `DMLoadingManager` correctly transitions to the `.success` state.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Call the `showSuccess(_:provider:)` method with a success message and a `DMLoadingViewProvider` object.
  - [✅] Verify that the `loadableState` is `.success`.
  - [✅] Verify that the inactivity timer is started with the delay specified in `settings.autoHideDelay`.
  - [✅] Wait for the auto-hide delay and verify that the `loadableState` transitions back to `.none`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` is `.success` immediately after the call.
  - The inactivity timer is started.
  - After the delay, the `loadableState` transitions to `.none`.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 4: ✅ Verify Failure State
- **Description**: Check if the `DMLoadingManager` correctly transitions to the `.failure` state.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Call the `showFailure(_:provider:onRetry:)` method with an error and optional retry action.
  - [✅] Verify that the `loadableState` is `.failure`.
  - [✅] Verify that the inactivity timer is started with the delay specified in `settings.autoHideDelay`.
  - [❌] If `onRetry` is provided, verify that the retry action is callable.
  - [✅] Wait for the auto-hide delay and verify that the `loadableState` transitions back to `.none`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` is `.failure` immediately after the call.
  - The inactivity timer is started.
  - The retry action is callable (if provided).
  - After the delay, the `loadableState` transitions to `.none`.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 5: ✅ Verify Hide State
- **Description**: Check if the `DMLoadingManager` correctly transitions to the `.none` state when `hide()` is called.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Set the `loadableState` to `.loading`, `.success`, or `.failure`.
  - [✅] Call the `hide()` method.
  - [✅] Verify that the `loadableState` is `.none`.
  - [✅] Verify that the inactivity timer is stopped.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` is `.none`.
  - The inactivity timer is stopped.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 6: ✅ Verify Conformance to ObservableObject
- **Description**: Ensure that `DMLoadingManager` conforms to `ObservableObject` and reacts to state changes correctly.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Create an instance of `DMLoadingManager`.
  - [✅] Observe changes to the `loadableState` using Combine's `@Published` property wrapper.
  - [✅] Trigger state changes (e.g., `.loading`, `.success`, `.failure`) and verify that the view updates accordingly.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` updates correctly and triggers view updates.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

---

### Scenario 7: ✅ Verify Auto-Hide Delay Behavior
- **Description**: Ensure that the `loadableState` does not transition to `.none` before the expected delay of `\(secondsAutoHideDelay)` seconds.
- **Steps**:
  - [✅] Call the `showSuccess(_:provider:)` or `showFailure(_:provider:onRetry:)` method.
  - [✅] Wait for less than `settings.autoHideDelay` seconds and verify that the `loadableState` remains `.success` or `.failure`.
  - [✅] Wait for the full `settings.autoHideDelay` duration and verify that the `loadableState` transitions to `.none`.
- **Expected Result**:
  - The `loadableState` remains `.success` or `.failure` until the full `settings.autoHideDelay` duration has elapsed.
  - After the delay, the `loadableState` transitions to `.none`.
- **Status**: ? / 🚧 / ❌ / ✅

| Method               | Input Data                          | Expected Output                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|

| Show Success        | Success message: `"Operation Completed"`, `DMLoadingViewProvider` | `.success` state with auto-hide delay |
| Show Failure        | Error: `NSError(domain: "Test", code: 404)`, `DMLoadingViewProvider` | `.failure` state with auto-hide delay |
| Hide                | None                                | `.none` state                         |

## 4. Notes
- Use snapshot testing (if applicable) to verify the visual appearance of views managed by `DMLoadingManager`.
- Use unit inspection to programmatically validate state transitions, timers, and reactive programming behavior.
- Ensure that all tests are performed on multiple devices and screen sizes to verify responsiveness.
- Localization testing should cover at least two languages (e.g., English and Ukrainian) if your app supports localization.

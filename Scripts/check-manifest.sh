# 1. The manifest has no dependency by branch or revision, uses no plugin on any target
#    and does not read the environment. SwiftPM refuses a version requirement on a package
#    that has an unstable dependency, a build plugin of a dependency runs in every
#    consumer's build, and a manifest that reads the environment describes more than one
#    package.
# 2. Fixtures/Consumer builds in Swift 6 and in Swift 5 language mode, and its own sources
#    compile without a warning. It uses the released API and the README samples, so if it
#    stops building, a consumer's code stops building.
